# Miniature-Growth-Chamber
This is an electronics project that aims to create a miniaturised version of growth chamber to cultivate Arabidopsis under microscope under a long period of time. The problem reseachers have is the grow light that the plants need would interfere with some microscope such as the Raman microscope which is supposed to work without any surrounding light interference.

Hence, the project is aim-ed to create a 'light tight' microchamber that is small enough to fit under the microscope while also provide appropriate grow light to cultivate plants.

During my research, I've found out the LEDs would dissipate some heat that can be unconfortable for the plant, which leads me to create a novel solution prototype that uses fibre optic end glow light pipe to transfer light from remotely located LEDs.

Yet, I still continued my research on the original method of installing LEDs inside the growth chamber and found out that the heat dissipation isn't bad at all.

Here you would see 2 EAGLE files for PCB design, which are for both novel and origianl solution. 

The single AutoCAD file holds the microchamber design for both novel and original solution.
